Tundra Animals Simulation on a console

 We are simulating the animals of the tundra. There are colonies of prey and predator animals. The number of animals in a colony affect the number of animals in other colonies. There are three predator species: the snowy owl, the arctic fox and the wolf. There are three kinds of prey: the lemming, the arctic hare and the gopher.
 If the number of prey animals increase, predators can reproduce more quickly. If the number of prey is very large, most of them will wander away because they cannot find enough food. If the number of predators is large, the number of the prey decreases quicker as they are preyed upon. 
Each colony has a name, a species, and the number of animals in the colony. The prey species are affected by the different predator species as follows. The number of animals in their own colony changes first, then they influence the predator
